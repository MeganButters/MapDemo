# Everless Adventures
Everless Adventures is based on the character Jules, a peasant within the Everless Kingdom. The King recently died, and the Queen came into power. Instead of ruling fairly, the kingdom fell into despair under her rule. In a world where time is money, the Queen has stolen the people's time to avoid meeting the same fate as the late-king. 

You, Jules, have been chosen by the people to sneak into the castle and return everyone's time. But it's a bit more complicated than that. First, you must find the four keys needed to open the vault, and you must do this without being caught by the Queen.

Be quick before time runs out for both you and your family. Good Luck.
